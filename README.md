#ï£¿WATCH Toon HQ Toontown Rewritten Invasions

[Toon HQ](http://toonhq.org) is created by the awesome [Luke Sapan](https://github.com/lsapan) 
Many thanks to him for the awesome invasion API. 

I am not 100% sure if this API is public so it is best that you check with him before doing anything with it. 

Now that we have that out of the way, what does this app do? Well, as you know Apple released their WatchKit SDK Nov 18th and I wanted to create a useful app to play around with the API's. 

Currently, all the app fetches the current invaisons and tapping on them will give you more details such as time left, district, and approximately how many cogs are defated for per minute. Kinda cool, right?

Here are a few screenshots
